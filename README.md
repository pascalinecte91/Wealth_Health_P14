You work for the technology department of a large financial company, WealthHealth. 

The company uses an internal web application called HRnet, which manages employee files. The application is old and uses jQuery on the front end, which leads to considerable bugs and an increase in internal complaints. Your development team has been working on upgrading the application for some time now.

---

  ## Summary of the main tasks : 

- Convert the entire HRNet project to React. 
- Convert one of the four current jQuery plugins to React.  
- Replace the 3 remaining jQuery plugins with React components that you code       yourself, or that you can import from existing libraries if you're short of time. 
- Carry out Lighthouse performance tests comparing the old and new applications. 

### TODO : 
- Make a new version of the "Create Employee" and "Employee List" pages with React.
- Add a state management system (the current version uses local storage).
- Ensure that everything is consistent in terms of style.  
- To do this, redesign the application, but if you want to change the style to something more modern, you're welcome to do so. 

### If you have time :  
- Test the React code with a suite of unit tests. 
- Otherwise, only manual tests are necessary.
